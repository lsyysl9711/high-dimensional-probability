# high-dimensional-probability

This repo will contain the solutions for book "high dimensional probability: An introduction with Applications in Data Science"

There is one existed solution(https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/338822722) for this book, but it is not complete. I use this solution manual as a reference. 

Comments and Corrections are welcome!
